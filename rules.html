        <h1>Rules of The Game</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The computer picks a sequence of colors. The number of colors is the
            code length.
          </li>

          <li>
            The objective of the game is to guess the exact positions of the
            colors in the computer's sequence.
          </li>

          <li>
            By default, a color can be used only once in a code sequence. If you
            start a new game with the 'Allow duplicates' checked, then any color
            can be used any number of times in the code sequence.
          </li>

          <li>
            After filling a line with your guesses and clicking on the 'Check'
            button, the computer responses with the result of your guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each color in your guess that is in the correct color and
            correct position in the code sequence, the computer display a small
            red color on the right side of the current guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each color in your guess that is in the correct color but is NOT
            in the correct position in the code sequence, the computer display a
            small white color on the right side of the current guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each color in your guess that is not the correct, the computer
            displays a small black color on the right side of the guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            You win the game when you manage to guess all the colors in the code
            sequence and when they all in the right position.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>How to play the game</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Start a new game by clicking on the 'Start Game' button. If you wish
            to change the default game parameters, you may change the 'Allow
            duplicates' field before clicking on the 'Start Game' button.
          </li>

          <li>
            To start filling a line, you must first select a color at the bottom
            of the table by clicking on it. After selecting a color you can just
            put it in the current guess line above by clicking on the desired
            position.
          </li>

          <li>
            After filling a whole line, you can still change your selection
            before asking the computer to respond to your guess. When you're
            satisfied with your guess, just click on the 'Check' button and get
            the computer response.
          </li>

          <li>You have 10 attempts to guess the code sequence. Good Luck!</li>
